  MapPipe allows us to run a function in a template
  for example, you need to filter out some elements from the array before displaying these elements. You can call a function for getting filtered array
  directly from template, but this function will be triggered everytime when user interacts with page.
  MapPipe allows you to call a function through this pipe, so function will be called only when necessary.
  Usage:
    we have function in .ts file that's called filterZeroValues
    in template we can use this function:
    *ngFor="let item in elements | map : filterZeroValues"
    where the first parameter of map pipe is function to be called, and other parameters will be passed as arguments to this function
    Important note: as you can see from implementation, elements array will be passed to your function as a first argument
